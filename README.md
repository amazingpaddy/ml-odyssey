# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of machine learning projects! This repository contains a collection of notebooks where I explore various datasets, apply different machine learning algorithms, and practice the end-to-end data science workflow.

My goal is to continuously add new projects, tackling different challenges and exploring a wide range of techniques, from foundational models to advanced deep learning architectures.

## Projects

Below is a summary of the projects included in this repository. Each project includes a detailed notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.

### 1. Iris Species Classification

*   **Objective:** To build a model that can accurately classify the species of an iris flower (*setosa*, *versicolor*, or *virginica*) based on its sepal and petal measurements.
*   **Model Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   Performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.
    *   Used `StandardScaler` to preprocess the data, a crucial step for distance-based algorithms like KNN.
    *   Split the data and trained a `KNeighborsClassifier`.
    *   Evaluated the model using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.
    *   Conducted hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal value for `k` (n_neighbors) and visualized the results to demonstrate the bias-variance tradeoff.
