# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of machine learning projects! This repository contains a collection of notebooks where I explore various datasets, apply different machine learning algorithms, and practice the end-to-end data science workflow.

My goal is to continuously add new projects, tackling different challenges and exploring a wide range of techniques, from foundational models to advanced deep learning architectures.

## Projects

Below is a summary of the projects included in this repository. Each project includes a detailed notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.

### 1. Iris Species Classification

*   **Notebook:** [`iris-project/iris_prediction.ipynb`](./iris-project/iris_prediction.ipynb)
*   **Objective:** To build a model that can accurately classify the species of an iris flower (*setosa*, *versicolor*, or *virginica*) based on its sepal and petal measurements.
*   **Model Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated feature distributions and the relationships between them, revealing strong correlations between petal measurements and the target species.
    *   **Preprocessing:** Applied `StandardScaler` to the features. This is a crucial step that prevents features with larger scales from disproportionately influencing the distance calculations in the KNN algorithm.
    *   **Modeling & Evaluation:** Trained a `KNeighborsClassifier` and evaluated its performance using a confusion matrix and classification report, achieving an initial accuracy score.
    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Systematically tested different values for `k` (n_neighbors) to find the optimal balance between bias and variance, which improved the model's final predictive accuracy.
*   **Result:** The final model achieved an accuracy of [Your Final Accuracy]% on the test set.
